This is a simple Python program using OpenPyXL and Selenium to automate a mileage spreadsheet to the webpage's spreadsheet.
Usage:
The program is compiled into a single executable file found within the Executable_File folder. Simply drag the spreadsheet into the same directory and run main.exe and follow the prompts.

I have only tested this with Chrome, .xlsx spreadsheet files, and I have not done any data validation or anything yet, so this is a pretty fragile program.

Let me know if you find any bugs, but I can't guarantee I'll get to them :P
